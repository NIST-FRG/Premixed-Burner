# Shakedown Test 42

October 4, 2024

This experiment is labelled "42"  because it is part of a series of experiments to test the pre-mixed burner. All previous experiments were scrubbed because the Venturi valve that mixes air and fuel was found to leak and had to be replaced by the manufacturer. This was the first experiment using the new Venturi mixer and a new mass flow controller for air.

The objective of this experiment was to produce a stoichiometric air/fuel pre-mixed flame while testing all the equipment. The natural gas flow was set to a constant value to achieve a 50 kW fire. The air flow rate was ramped up to 1000 L/min in increments of 200 L/min. A stoichiometric mixure was achieved with an air flow rate of 870 L/min. The maximum air flow rate of the controller is 1000 L/min. The house air regulator was set at 75 psi for the entire experiment.

Four radiometers were placed at various distances from the fire at a height of 3 ft off the floor. HF-N and HF-E were 6 feet away, HF-S was 10 ft away, and HF-W was 12 ft, 10 in (130 in) away.
