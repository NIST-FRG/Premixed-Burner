# Shakedown Test 42

The objective of this experiment was to produce a stoichiometric air/fuel pre-mixed flame while testing all the equipment.

This experiment was conducted on October 4, 2024. A new mass flow controller and Venturi mixer were used for the first time. The maximum air flow rate is 1000 L/min. The house air regulator was set at 75 psi to produce the maximum flow.

Natural gas was pumped into the burner to achieve a 50 kW fire. Air was introduced in increments of 200 L/min. A stoichiometric mixure was achieved with an air flow rate of 870 L/min.

The radiometers were placed at various distances from the fire at a height of 3 ft off the floor. HF-N and HF-E were 6 feet away, HF-S was 10 ft away, and HF-W was 12 ft, 10 in away.
