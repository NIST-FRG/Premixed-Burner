# Shakedown Test 43

October 23, 2024

This experiment is labelled "43"  because it is part of a series of experiments to test the pre-mixed burner. This experiment is a repeat of Shakedown Test 42 except that FTIR measurements were made in the exhaust stream to detect unburned hydrocarbons.

The objective of this experiment was to produce a stoichiometric air/fuel pre-mixed flame while testing all the equipment. The natural gas flow was set to a constant value to achieve a 50 kW fire. The air flow rate was ramped up to 1000 L/min in increments of 200 L/min. A stoichiometric mixure was achieved with an air flow rate of 870 L/min. The maximum air flow rate of the controller is 1000 L/min. The house air regulator was set at 75 psi for the entire experiment.

Four radiometers were placed at various distances from the fire at a height of 3 ft off the floor. HF-N and HF-E were 6 feet away, HF-S was 10 ft away, and HF-W was 12 ft, 10 in (130 in) away.
